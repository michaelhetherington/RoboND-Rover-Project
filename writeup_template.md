**The goals / steps of this project are the following:**  

**Training / Calibration**  

* Download the simulator and take data in "Training Mode"
* Test out the functions in the Jupyter Notebook provided
* Add functions to detect obstacles and samples of interest (golden rocks)
* Fill in the `process_image()` function with the appropriate image processing steps (perspective transform, color threshold etc.) to get from raw images to a map.  The `output_image` you create in this step should demonstrate that your mapping pipeline works.
* Use `moviepy` to process the images in your saved dataset with the `process_image()` function.  Include the video you produce as part of your submission.

**Autonomous Navigation / Mapping**

* Fill in the `perception_step()` function within the `perception.py` script with the appropriate image processing functions to create a map and update `Rover()` data (similar to what you did with `process_image()` in the notebook). 
* Fill in the `decision_step()` function within the `decision.py` script with conditional statements that take into consideration the outputs of the `perception_step()` in deciding how to issue throttle, brake and steering commands. 
* Iterate on your perception and decision function until your rover does a reasonable (need to define metric) job of navigating and mapping.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/916/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

This is my Writeup / README for the Project: Search and Sample Return. To complete this project I worked through each step of the Udacity Robotics Nanodegree section 1. Introduction to Robotics. Admittedly, while I could readily read and comprehend Python code presented to me, I found it much harder to develop my own implementations. As such I was heavily reliant on the project work through posted by Udacity on YouTube. I believe that as I work through the course the appropriate code and its structure will become more familiar to me.

### Notebook Analysis
#### 1. Run the functions provided in the notebook on test images (first with the test data provided, next on data you have recorded). Add/modify functions to allow for color selection of obstacles and rock samples.
Below I provide details and illustrative examples of how I progressed through the iPython Notebook test notebook.

First of all was to perform the *Perspective Transform* to transform the images seen from the Rover's perspective in to a top-down map of the environment. To undertake the perspective transform it was necessary to do some interrogation of the calibration images to be able to map the size of the source image to the destination map coordinates. For this part I followed the example to ensure I had appropriate offsets and transformations. Couple with this step is the creation of a top-down mask to cut out any part of the resultant warped image beyond the view of the Rover.

Next step was to perform the *Colour Thresholding* to distinguish between navigable and non-navigable terrain. An example of the warped image with the colour thresholding applied is shown in the following image.

Further to performing the colour thresholding step was to also include code that could identify rocks within the images generated by the Rover. This step I have coded into a function named *find_rock* and produces the transformation seen between the two following images.

#### 1. Populate the `process_image()` function with the appropriate analysis steps to map pixels identifying navigable terrain, obstacles and rock samples into a worldmap.  Run `process_image()` on your test data using the `moviepy` functions provided to create video output of your result. 

The next step was to combine all the test code developed and described above. To complete this I followed the guidelines provided in the iPython Notebook. I drew heavily from the project walkthrough video for this section, particularly for guidance on how to update the *data* dictionary.

My test video can be viewed [from my GitHub repo](https://github.com/michaelhetherington/RoboND-Rover-Project/blob/master/output/test_mapping.mp4?raw=true)

### Autonomous Navigation and Mapping

#### 1. Fill in the `perception_step()` (at the bottom of the `perception.py` script) and `decision_step()` (in `decision.py`) functions in the autonomous mapping scripts and an explanation is provided in the writeup of how and why these functions were modified as they were.

To complete these steps I copied across the test code from the iPython Notebook improved upon in the preceeding steps. Further to this it was necessary to rename some of the function/class calls (e.g. 'data' class to 'Rover' class in perception.py). In addition to this renaming/code cohesiveness check it was necessary to include code to *update Rover World Map* (step #7 in the process-image() function).

#### 2. Launching in autonomous mode your rover can navigate and map autonomously.  Explain your results and how you might improve them in your writeup.  

**Note: running the simulator with different choices of resolution and graphics quality may produce different results, particularly on different machines!  Make a note of your simulator settings (resolution and graphics quality set on launch) and frames per second (FPS output to terminal by `drive_rover.py`) in your writeup when you submit the project so your reviewer can reproduce your results.**

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.  

My simulation environment adopted the following settings:
- System, MacOS 10.12.6
- Screen resolution, 1024x768
- Graphics quality, Good
- Windowed, Yes
- Input, default

To commence the autonomous simulation I first enabled the RoboND environment within Terminal with the command *source activate RoboND*. Once the correct environment was active I navigated to the folder containing the Python scrips I had edited and executed the drive-rover.py script using the command *python3 drive_rover.py*. Once the script was active (which did not occur on the first execution unfrotunately as I needed to correct bugs in my code) I opened the RoverSim software and initiated Autonomous Mode.

From here I observed my Romver autonomously navigate the simulation environment identifying those areas that were navigable as well as locating rocks. On  subsequent runs, fidelity typically averaged above 65% and more than 50% of the world was mapped. On occasion the Rover would however become trapped in a repetitious circuit where only mapped terrain would be explored. It was also observed that the Rover was unable to locate rocks that were more than slightly off-centre of the image received. the 

Observing the Rover navigate the simulation environment highlighted that further improvements such as the following could be made in future iterations to increase fidelity and speed of world mapping:
- I found that during some simulations that the Rover would become stuck at a non-navigable wall if I reduced the *go_forward* threshold too much (e.g. 250 pixels) in the drive-rover.py file. I managed this problem by using the default threshold (500 pixels)
- I found that the Rover would become constrained to follow a circuit over and over sometimes. This would lead the Rover to repeatedly explore areas of the world already mapped thus preventing it from discovering the whole world. In furture iterations I would intend to include a function that would prevent the Rover from exploring territory already mapped.
- Occasionally the Rover would come across a small non-navigable object (e.g. rock) so quickly that it wouldn't slow adequately and could become stuck. In furture iterations I would aim to increase the braking speed or reduce the maximum speed.
- Improve the rock discovery algorithm such that rocks that are slightly to significantly off-centre can be recognised.
- Devise optimisations that allow the rover to explore the world faster and avoid collisions with non-navigable terrain.

As I noted at the beginning of this write-up, I was highly dependent on the project walkthrough video to show me how to efficiently construct code for some key features of the Rover. I anticipate that as I progress through this course, and some others that I am completing concurrently, my Python problem solving abilities will improve. I also anticipate that my notes and existing code can be effectively re-cycled and restructured when solving future problems.
